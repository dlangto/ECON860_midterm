# Exam_1
# For the first part, run exam_1_pt_1_requests. This will download the website to your computer. To get Bonus data, run the code continuously until the data appears. From there, run exam_1_pt_1_parse. This will parse the file to a  csv. The csv may look messy, but it will have all the information from the website. 
# For the second part, run exam_1_pt_2_requests. This will download the information from the GitHub API. I was able to find all the information besides "starred." The information will be stored in a file called json_files. This file is not included in the reposuitory due to its size. Input your own GitHub request token in mytoken.py and your own username in the space contained by "dlangto". From there, run exam_1_pt_2_parse. This downloads the information to a csv file and creates a scatterplot relating followers and public repos. Below the code are comments relating to an economic question.
